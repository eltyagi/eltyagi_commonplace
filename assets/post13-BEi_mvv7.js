excerpt: Good APIs and good relationships have something in common: clear boundaries.

A well-designed API does one thing well. It has clear inputs, predictable outputs, and documented behavior.

It doesn't try to do everything. It doesn't expose its internal complexity. It maintains a contract with its consumers.

The best relationships work the same way. Clear communication. Predictable behavior. Respected boundaries. Simple interfaces hiding complex implementations.

Maybe software architecture is just relationship advice in disguise.
