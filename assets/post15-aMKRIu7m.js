In quantum physics, observation affects outcome. The particle behaves differently when watched.

We are no different. We perform for audiences, even audiences of one. We become what we measure.

Track your steps, and you walk more. Track your spending, and you spend less. Track your time, and you waste less of it.

Choose carefully what you observe. You will become it.
