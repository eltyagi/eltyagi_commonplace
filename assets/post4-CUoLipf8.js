I am a storm that rages on alone,
In the wake of your wildest dreams.
I am the breeze that flows over your sparkling eyes,
as you blindly spend your time it seems.

I am the wolf, that stalks in the dead of night,
a prey that he could never hunt.
I am the hunter that traps his world and more,
In the snare of a burning sun.

I am the wind that howls on a foggy night,
And hides away the pain of late.
I am the rain that touches the land of death,
and births a will to survive the fray.

And if you demand of me a sacrifice,
such that you could never reciprocate.
I would still stand my ground and hold out my arm,
To show you just how much I can take.

If only I could sit alone, and control what my mind creates.
If only I could stop in time, if only I could quit today.
But the cost of giving up on your soul, is one that you could never pay.
And so I rage on as the perfect storm.
For I may end, but not today.`;export{n as default};
