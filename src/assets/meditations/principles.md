My Guiding Principles:

1. Continuous Learning
   "Stay curious, stay humble. Every day offers a chance to learn something new."

2. Quality over Quantity
   "Better to do fewer things excellently than many things poorly."

3. Empathy in Design
   "Build for humans, not just for code. Consider the person behind every interaction."

4. Sustainable Progress
   "Progress isn't just about moving forward; it's about moving forward in a way that can be maintained."

Questions I Ask Myself:

• How can I make this better for the end user?
• What would I want if I were in their position?
• Is this solution sustainable and maintainable?
• Am I solving the right problem?
• How can I learn from this experience?
• What value am I creating for others?

These principles and questions guide my decisions, both in technology and in life. They remind me that behind every line of code, there's a human story waiting to be told.
