Here's the technology stack that I work with and love:

Frontend Development:
• React & TypeScript - For building robust user interfaces
• Vite - Lightning-fast build tool and development server
• CSS3 & Modern Styling - Creating beautiful, responsive designs

Development Tools:
• VS Code - My preferred code editor
• Git & GitHub - Version control and collaboration
• ESLint - Code quality and consistency

Design & Planning:
• Figma - UI/UX design and prototyping
• Notion - Project planning and documentation

Currently Learning:
• Advanced React patterns
• Backend development with Node.js
• Mobile development with React Native

The beauty of technology lies not just in what it can do, but in how elegantly it can solve real-world problems.
