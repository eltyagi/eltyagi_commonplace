excerpt: I wonder if I could hold a fight, with no fight left in me.
---

As I watch the exploits of better men, from the comforts of my hotel room.
Wondering if I could ever measure up to their 1000 yard gaze.
If I could walk into a wall of bullets, and still manage a laugh or two.

If I could crawl into the wrath of death, vulnerable, yet unfazed.
I wonder if I could ever measure up to their relentless pursuit,
Their need to hunt beyond the horizon,
and into the fiery depth of the enemyâ€™s abode.

I wonder if I could hold a fight, with no fight left in me.
If my legacy could be stories of battles seldom told.
