One pushup doesn't build muscle. One page doesn't write a book. One conversation doesn't build a relationship.

But one pushup every day for a year? One page every day for a year? One meaningful conversation every day for a year?

That's 365 pushups, 365 pages, 365 connections. That's transformation hiding in plain sight.

The compound effect doesn't care about motivation. It only cares about consistency.
