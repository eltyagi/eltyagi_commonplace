The sun sets early now,
Painting the sky in shades of fire.
Winter light is different—
Sharper, clearer, more precious.

We huddle closer in the cold,
Find warmth in shared spaces.
The darkness teaches us
To cherish what illuminates.

Spring will come again,
As it always does.
But first, we learn to love
The beauty of the dark.
