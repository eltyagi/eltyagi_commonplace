Today, I settle in for the long night. One of many, which have elevated destiny itself. A drive through the heart of complacency and up Sisyphus’s slope.

A drive through the valley of a thousand peaks, each more worthy than the last. Despite the rocky climb, there is warmth in this journey.

Like a dimply lit writer’s abode, in the shade of a candle light, to the rhythm of a lazy clock, on a smooth oak-wood desk, graced by ancient texts and coffee beans. There is glory in this solitude, for it’s a journey, into the soul.
