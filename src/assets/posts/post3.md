Anyone who has spent their formative years in the Indian schooling system is closely familiar with constant struggle that is the journey from kindergarten to employment. You are bombarded with pressure as you live from one exam to the other. Many are forced into “coaching institutes”, many suppress their passion never to look back until their last day on this planet. It’s a cutthroat competition to survive and move up the ladder of social heirarchy, in the hopes that you are afforded a basic level of human dignity in a society marred by corruption, discrimination and hate.

You either take every opportunity and make the most of it, or you crash and burn. Worse yet, spend your life in one of the many sweatshops that India has gifted the world, or wander the streets aimlessly as a volunteer for political and religious vendetta, destroying what little semblance of peace the citizens of this country have.

I have watched countless children give away their childhood very few educational institutions that we can afford to offer our youth. And many who would live a life of utter and complete defeat if they fail. Worse yet, thousands who waste their youth chasing an exam which promises to give them power and money in a country stalled by the utter virus that is our civil service.

It’s a fate worse than death, to be not only be stripped away of any color in your life, but to also be rendered unemployable and borderline incompetent because what you sacrificed your dreams for was never going to give you the success you wanted anyway.

How can we hope for excellence when our children are surrounded by mediocrity? Mediocrity in the classroom, taught by industry rejects with little interest in training a new generation for the challenges of the modern world. Mediocrity in parenting, with parents doing everything in their power to suppress their children under the guise of best intentions. Mediocrity in leadership, a country run by corrupt baffoons, eating away at our nation one day at a time. Where must a young Indian look to learn and become more than the mediocrity that plagues our nation?

As a nation, we take pride in shortcuts and lack of integrity. We haggle endlessly to get that which we haven’t earned. We blame all but ourselves for the problems that plague us. We regard others and each other as lesser beings for any reason we care to justify. And that is what we teach our children so they can continue to carry this corruption over the coming decades of our future. It is the cycle of our destruction, our curse.
