When code breaks, we don't panic. We isolate variables, test hypotheses, trace the execution path.

Why don't we approach life's problems the same way?

That relationship issue? Isolate the variables. That career stagnation? Test a hypothesis. That persistent unhappiness? Trace the execution path back to its source.

Debugging isn't just for computers.
