      - generic [ref=e26]: Personal
      - generic [ref=e27]: I'm a passionate developer and creative thinker who finds beauty in both code and the world around me. My journey in technology has been shaped by curiosity, continuous learning, and a deep appreciation for elegant solutions to complex problems.
      - generic [ref=e36]: Through my work, I strive to create experiences that are not just functional, but meaningful. Whether I'm writing code, exploring new technologies, or capturing moments through photography, I believe in the power of thoughtful creation and the importance of staying connected to the world beyond the screen. Life is a collection of moments—some captured, some remembered, all contributing to who we are. These images represent the balance I seek between the digital and the natural, the structured and the spontaneous, the technical and the artistic. Each photograph is a reminder to pause, observe, and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us every day.
