      - generic [ref=e34]: As I watch the exploits of better men, from the comforts of my hotel room. Wondering if I could ever measure up to their 1000 yard gaze. If I could walk into a wall of bullets, and still manage a laugh or two. If I could crawl into the wrath of death, vulnerable, yet unfazed. I wonder if I could ever measure up to their relentless pursuit, Their need to hunt beyond the horizon, and into the fiery depth of the enemy's abode. I wonder if I could hold a fight, with no fight left in me. If my legacy could be stories of battles seldom told.
